## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Logic Structure

The system implements specialized social services hiring and evaluation logic across three primary components:

### Personality Assessment Engine (85/100)
Path: modules/assessment.js
- Six-dimensional professional personality evaluation system
- Trauma-informed care focused archetype matching
- Core dimensions:
  - People/Task Focus
  - Structure/Flexibility
  - Independent/Collaborative
  - Stability/Innovation
  - Harmony/Truth
  - Internal/External Stress
- Four social services archetypes:
  - Relationship Builder
  - Thoughtful Organizer
  - Adaptive Connector
  - Careful Listener

### Interview Evaluation System (80/100)
Path: modules/interview.js
- Child/family services specialized scoring framework
- Social services red/green flag identification
- Six evaluation dimensions:
  - Interview Reflection
  - Crisis Response Scenarios
  - Self-Assessment
  - Values Alignment
  - Team Support Requirements
  - Decision Framework

### Assessment Integration Layer (70/100)
Path: scripts/google-apps-script.js
- Automated personality dimension scoring
- Social services archetype matching
- Specialized reporting for family services context
- Decision framework integration

## Domain-Specific Patterns

The system employs four unique evaluation frameworks:
1. Trauma-informed candidate assessment
2. Family services competency evaluation
3. Values-based personality profiling
4. Social services risk flag identification

The personality assessment engine represents the core business logic, combining trauma-informed care considerations with social services archetype matching for candidate evaluation.
